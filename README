# System Monitoring Dashboard Script

This script provides a real-time dashboard for monitoring various system resources. It refreshes the data every few seconds and allows users to call specific parts of the dashboard individually using command-line switches.

## Features

1. **Top 10 Most Used Applications**
   - Displays the top 10 applications consuming the most CPU and memory.

2. **Network Monitoring**
   - Number of concurrent connections to the server.
   - Packet drops.
   - Number of MB in and out.

3. **Disk Usage**
   - Displays the disk space usage by mounted partitions.
   - Highlights partitions using more than 80% of the space.

4. **System Load**
   - Shows the current load average for the system.
   - Includes a breakdown of CPU usage (user, system, idle, etc.).

5. **Memory Usage**
   - Displays total, used, and free memory.
   - Swap memory usage.

6. **Process Monitoring**
   - Displays the number of active processes.
   - Shows top 5 processes in terms of CPU and memory usage.

7. **Service Monitoring**
   - Monitors the status of essential services like sshd, nginx/apache, iptables, etc.

8. **Custom Dashboard**
   - Provides command-line switches to view specific parts of the dashboard, e.g., `-cpu`, `-memory`, `-network`, etc.

## Usage

### Running the Full Dashboard

To run the full dashboard, execute the script without any arguments:

```bash
./monitor.sh



## Viewing Specific Parts of the Dashboard ##

You can view specific parts of the dashboard using the following command-line switches:

CPU and Memory Usage of Top Applications:
./monitor.sh -cpu

Network Monitoring:
./monitor.sh -network

Disk Usage:
./monitor.sh -disk

System Load:
./monitor.sh -load

Memory Usage:
./monitor.sh -memory

Process Monitoring:
./monitor.sh -process

Service Monitoring:
./monitor.sh -service

## Customization and Extension
The script is designed to be easily customizable and extendable. You can add more monitoring functions or modify existing ones to suit your needs. For example, you can add a function to monitor additional services or include more detailed network statistics.

## Evaluation Criteria
Correctness and Completeness: The script should accurately monitor and display the specified system resources.
Efficiency and Performance: The script should efficiently update the data in real-time without causing significant system load.
Usability and Documentation: The script should be easy to use, and the README should provide clear instructions and examples.
Customizability: The script should be easy to customize and extend for additional monitoring requirements.
